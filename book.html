      <p>Update 1.0 - God wants to take bad some spelling errors..... for now</p>

<p>Lil’ D’s Book</p>

<p>Translated by Dan Ch. Le 2015</p>

<p>“Lil’ D’s Book” is The Book of Lil’ D</p>

<p>Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of TS (Transitional Saints), and also of the EEPers (Eternal Essence of People) – written to the EEPers, who are a remnant of the house of Israel; and also to the Jew and Gentile – Written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation — Written and hidden, so that people don’t destroy this noteworthy book. It has also been saved onto multiple holy USBs and the Cloud of eternal life, so that it may be duplicated and distributed for many years to come.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: Although the previous and future sections may seem plagiarized, God has chosen to repeat many of his words. Any misspellings are purely intentional, for it is the will of God to imitate the imperfection of man</p>

<p>The Gospel, according to Lil’ D</p>

<hr color="#005566" width="85%" />

<p>BOOK I</p>

<p>The Journey of the Transitional Saints</p>

<p>I Dan Le, descendant of Dan, the 5th son of Jacob and founder of the Israelite Tribe of Dan, hereby proclaim the following as truths, and that my genealogy was traced back with modern technologies and confirmed my heritage, but the Lord, our savoir has also confirmed this as well. The many grammatical and spelling errors encountered within this holy work is purely intended, as God wishes to speak through man’s long history of err, and that nothing is perfect but the Lord himself. In other words, this book is imperfect and is subject to change without notice:</p>

<p>The archangel, Veytew, appeared in mine dreams on the night of October 1st, 2015. He spoke and said to me,” Lil’ D, the Lord has been displeased with those who have concluded that science be incompatible with the worship of Him. Although He promised Noah that He would not destroy the world ones more, the Lord has hinted to Lucifer to clear the world of the ignoble presence of all humans, good or bad alike. You must find the Chosen Juan to march into the depths of Hell to commit a brave deed of valor to convince the Lord otherwise. Good luck, thee have one year to complete this task."</p>
<p>InterMISSION: Nike, and the Quest for the Tater Tot</p>

<p>One day, Saint Nike was really hungry. The good news was that it was lunch, but she didn't have a lunch. No one, of course, would share their lunch because they needed to eat too (and the fact that she was Nike didn't help). Underneath her masquerade of innocence, she really really, wanted to eat somebody. Nike envisioned within her mind a feast of the flesh of the other Saints, which would not only satisfy her craving for food, but also make her throw up. Thus, she would be hungry again and continue to eat. Because she would have eaten more than what was necessary, she would have been committing the sin of gluttony... which Nike soon realized that God wouldn't approve.</p> 

<p>But there was indeed salvation for her sinful thoughts. It was called, The HUB (Holy Union Building). And so God sent Phanuel, angel of repentance and hope, to tell Saint Brock to take Nike to the HUB so that Nike's craving for food would be satisfied.</p>

<p>And so it came to pass, that they arrived at on of the fast food burger place within the HUB. Nike ordered the chicken tender meal, while Brock ordered a bag of French fries. All was saved and you, avid reader, may stop reading. But one does not simply get redeemed by God with a chicken tender meal. Nike's gluttonous thoughts may have been purged, but God would have to test her first. </p>

<p>And so it came to pass, that Brock opened his paper bag, and found that it was not a bag of French fries, but a bag of French fries... and a tater tot. Now, Nike had OCD, and could not control the imperfect, unbalanced symmetry of this terrible nightmare. She quickly vacuumed the tainted entity of the tater tot. The first test was failed, for she had stolen Brock's food!</p>

<p>Days went by, and Nike and Brock continued to buy chicken tender meals and French fries (respectively), some days had an annoying tater tot. Other days did not. Brock recorded days that had a tater tot with a 1, and days with no tater tots with a 0. He looked at his chart one day and this was what he received: 1-0-0-1-0-0-1</p>

<p>... To Be Continued</p>
