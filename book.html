      <p>Update 1.0 - God wants to take bad some spelling errors..... for now</p>

<p>Lil’ D’s Book</p>

<p>Translated by Dan Ch. Le 2015</p>

<p>“Lil’ D’s Book” is The Book of Lil’ D</p>

<p>Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of TS (Transitional Saints), and also of the EEPers (Eternal Essence of People) – written to the EEPers, who are a remnant of the house of Israel; and also to the Jew and Gentile – Written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation — Written and hidden, so that people don’t destroy this noteworthy book. It has also been saved onto multiple holy USBs and the Cloud of eternal life, so that it may be duplicated and distributed for many years to come.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: Although the previous and future sections may seem plagiarized, God has chosen to repeat many of his words.</p>

<p>The Gospel, according to Lil’ D</p>

<p>BOOK I</p>

<p>The Journey of the Transitional Saints</p>

<p>I Dan Le, descendant of Dan, the 5th son of Jacob and founder of the Israelite Tribe of Dan, hereby proclaim the following as truths, and that my genealogy was traced back with modern technologies and confirmed my heritage, but the Lord, our savoir has also confirmed this as well. The many grammatical and spelling errors encountered within this holy work is purely intended, as God wishes to speak through man’s long history of err, and that nothing is perfect but the Lord himself. In other words, this book is imperfect and is subject to change without notice:</p>

<p>The archangel, Veytew, appeared in mine dreams on the night of October 1st, 2015. He spoke and said to me,” Lil’ D, the Lord has been displeased with those who have concluded that science be incompatible with the worship of Him. Although He promised Noah that He would not destroy the world ones more, the Lord has hinted to Lucifer to clear the world of the ignoble presence of all humans, good or bad alike. You must find the Chosen Juan to march into the depths of Hell to commit a brave deed of valor to convince the Lord otherwise. Good luck, thee have one year to complete this task."</p>
