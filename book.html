<p>Lil’ D’s Book</p>

<p>Translated by Dan Ch. Le 2015</p>

<p>“Lil’ D’s Book” is The Book of Lil’ D</p>

<p>Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of TS (Transitional Saints), and also of the EEPers (Eternal 
Essence of People) – written to the EEPers, who are a remnant of the house of Israel; and also to the Jew and Gentile – Written
by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation — Written and hidden, so that people don’t destroy 
this noteworthy book. It has also been saved onto multiple holy USBs and the Cloud of eternal life, so that it may be duplicated
and distributed for many years to come.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: Although the previous and future sections may seem plagiarized, God has chosen to repeat many of his words. Any 
misspellings are purely intentional, for it is the will of God to imitate the imperfection of man</p>

<p>The Gospel, according to Lil’ D</p>

<p>BOOK I</p>

<p>The Journey of the Transitional Saints</p>

<p>I Dan Le, descendant of Dan, the 5th son of Jacob and founder of the Israelite Tribe of Dan, hereby proclaim the following as
truths, and that my genealogy was traced back with modern technologies and confirmed my heritage, but the Lord, our savoir has 
also confirmed this as well. The many grammatical and spelling errors encountered within this holy work is purely intended, as 
God wishes to speak through man’s long history of err, and that nothing is perfect but the Lord himself. In other words, this 
book is imperfect and is subject to change without notice:</p>

<p>The archangel, Veytew, appeared in mine dreams on the night of October 1st, 2015. He spoke and said to me,” Lil’ D, the Lord
has been displeased with those who have concluded that science be incompatible with the worship of Him. Although He promised 
Noah that He would not destroy the world ones more, the Lord has hinted to Lucifer to clear the world of the ignoble presence 
of all humans, good or bad alike. You must find the Chosen Juan to march into the depths of Hell to commit a brave deed of valor 
to convince the Lord otherwise. Good luck, thee have one year to complete this task."</p>
<p>InterMISSION: Nike, and the Quest for the Tater Tot</p>

<p>One day, Saint Nike was really hungry. The good news was that it was lunch, but she didn't have a lunch. No one, of course,
would share their lunch because they needed to eat too (and the fact that she was Nike didn't help). Underneath her masquerade 
of innocence, she really really, wanted to eat somebody. Nike envisioned within her mind a feast of the flesh of the other 
Saints, which would not only satisfy her craving for food, but also make her throw up. Thus, she would be hungry again and 
continue to eat. Because she would have eaten more than what was necessary, she would have been committing the sin of 
gluttony... which Nike soon realized that God wouldn't approve.</p> 

<p>But there was indeed salvation for her sinful thoughts. It was called, The HUB (Holy Union Building). And so God sent Phanuel, 
angel of repentance and hope, to tell Saint Brock to take Nike to the HUB so that Nike's craving for food would be satisfied.</p>

<p>And so it came to pass, that they arrived at on of the fast food burger place within the HUB. Nike ordered the chicken tender 
meal, while Brock ordered a bag of French fries. All was saved and you, avid reader, may stop reading. But one does not simply
get redeemed by God with a chicken tender meal. Nike's gluttonous thoughts may have been purged, but God would have to test her
first. </p>

<p>And so it came to pass, that Brock opened his paper bag, and found that it was not a bag of French fries, but a bag of French
fries... and a tater tot. Now, Nike had OCD, and could not control the imperfect, unbalanced symmetry of this terrible 
nightmare. She quickly vacuumed the tainted entity of the tater tot. The first test was failed, for she had stolen Brock's 
food!</p>

<p>Days went by, and Nike and Brock continued to buy chicken tender meals and French fries (respectively), some days had an 
annoying tater tot. Other days did not. Brock recorded days that had a tater tot with a 1, and days with no tater tots with a 
0. He looked at his chart one day and this was what he received: 1-0-0-1-0-0-1</p>

<p>... To Be Continued</p>
<p>It was October, 16th when Lil’ D started his perilous journey. He did not know what to do, and what to believe in, so God 
put snail mail into Lil’ D’s backpack. It contained the TRUE path that all of mankind should path. Here is the translation, in
which no edits are made, and is completely genuine:</p>

<p>The One True Metamorphosis (TOTM) - Part 1, according to the words of God</p>

<p>Introduction</p>

<p>>Man, living under the shadow of science, Christianity, Scientology, whether they choose to believe it or not, are really 
worshiping the One True God. Every godly pantheon, including the mighty Zeus, Ra, Odin, and many others, are legitimate 
pseudo-gods. They are powerful beings, angels if you will, who governed the world in the absence of The Supreme Being. I, God, 
have many cycles of sleep, and although I have the power to govern, influence, and know all, it is better if there are several 
others that may guide the Human to salvation. May all know me as Big D. In Greek, the letter is D is known as Delta, or change.
In English, Capitalization is used for proper nouns, in which there is only a single entity that may fulfill its name. I am the
Great Change, and the eternal reward is to become one with me. Every single creation, after Armageddon, the great destruction 
and rebirth of the world, must come back and join with me. Science, is simply an explanation for how the world works. For every
gluon, atom, compound, or object in the physical world I have created for you, has a counterpart in the spiritual world, which
equally explains the cycle of the natural processes. To become, one and only with me is to follow the path of the Great Change.
There are many ways to travel across this path, and everyone’s challenges will be unique. But the destination and the road 
will always be the same. Acknowledge, for every belief that has circulated around the cosmos ends with me, Big D, and the path 
to eternal life awaits.</p>

<p>Lesson 1.1 – Intro to Eyebob, the Beacon of Light</p>

<p>Every saint, every holy man who rests in heaven, has followed the trail of Eyebob, the harbinger. It is Eyebob, the Frog Who
Lives a Hoppy Life, who paved the path to the Supreme Being. For Eyebob, this was a journey of his life. For others, the 
journey may take different times, but know that it is Eyebob’s route that you will follow. To follow Eyebob, is to live a happy
life. Like Eyebob the frog, you must take a leap of faith, from the lily pad of ignorance, to the lily pad of enlightenment 
where you will find the holy city above.</p>

<p>Lesson 1.2 – The Egg</p>

<p>Every being is a creation of God, who brings into his world the egg of existence. Every angel, human, animal, rock, and 
atom came from one of Big D’s will, and starts as an egg. Like every idea, each egg will mature differently and emerge having 
different properties. This is the basis of life. Unlike what was stated in Genesis, due to copying errors, God created animals,
not in his image, but because he felt like it. Soon, he got tired of creating the same eggs of thought over and over again, so 
he eventually refined, revised, and edited each animal until he made man, who he thought was the model organism. Man was not 
made in his image, but Man made Him in Hhis image (ambiguous pronoun with an uppercase and lowercase h intended for 
interpretation reasons). Despite this, man is not superior to the Lord. As such, know that evolution is both the butchering 
knife of natural selection, but also the evolution of God’s thoughts.</p>

<p>Lesson 1.3 – Metamorphosis</p>

<p>Life begins when you emerge from the egg of creation from God’s mind. You enter the world swimming in the vast space of 
other creations as a tadpole. At first, you are small and boring, and are only observing and learning about what is around 
you. Then, you start to make decisions for yourself and grow legs, which are vital to walking the path to deliverance. Legs, 
however, are very powerful tools, especially for locomotion. When misused, they can be utilized to stray from the Path. The
loss of the tail represents the feeling of freedom from the dense liquid of water. As a frog, you will now travel the land in
search of food of redemption, normally in the preaching of others. Land is a different place than the water. It will take time
to adapt, and there will be many obstacles. But that’s okay. Your transformation starts here, with the saying: nos convivium 
sic vos non habent, or, we party, so you don’t have to. To be continued…</p>

<p>Back to the Gospel of Lil’ D </p>

<p>That faithful day, where the story truly begins, was the day a portal to Hell opened. Several Transitional Saints were 
involved in a sacred ritual, called TSRF. Lil’ D happened to slap upon the cards 6, 6, and 6. Guthrie Annex 2 (the holy 
building), imploded, leaving the Transitional Saints among a very warm place. In front of them is a poet, by the name of 
Virgil. He said, “Welcome to the first level of Hell. I understand Beatrice, under commands from God has sent you here. You 
may be familiar with Dante, who unfortunately had a terrible memory and wrote down some false facts about Hell. You see, you 
are in the first section of the first circle, or commonly known as the Fields of Shytiie Victory, reserved for the pagans who 
won in really dumb ways.” He pointed at me and continued,” Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Lil’ D, the Prophet,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Then I am honored to be in your presence,” he pointed to another Transitional Saint, “and who are you?” This person formed 
a fist with his hand and brought it dramatically to his face.</p>

<p>“I am… Jordan, Brown… And I, hate the tea party.”</p>

<p>“Why, you certainly are a charismatic person!” And so this continued until all the saints were introduced. There were also:
Shiven, Gavin, Yu-Won, Marcell, Angela, Taylor, Altan, Nikita, Maxwell, Arianna, Caitlin, Maxine, Anne, Nike, Nico, and Brock.
“Unfortunately, I cannot simply give you a tour of this fascinating place…” sighed Virgil, “You will have to pass a test. You
must surpass all the Shytiie Victories ever made in a game of ultimate flying divine disk, or Frisbee.” I was put into a team 
with Altan, Nikita, Yu-Won, Maxwell and Elisa (an EEPer). We were set against Conrad (some random non-transitional saint), 
Shiven, Taylor, Arianna, Caitlin, and Mason (an EEPer). </p>              

<p>The game started as an intense battle, and soon, it was obvious that the second team mentioned was going to win. They were 
ahead by 6000 points in the first 10 minutes. But suddenly, the clouds parted, and Altan saw an angel choir appear, cheering
him on. Michelangelo, the angel of war, scooped up Altan, and raised him a mile high into the sky, and he caught the impossible
catch. Now, the devil, because he is always behind things, made it look like Altan missed the catch, but this was not so. Only
the pure were able to see this, and Altan, by divine intervention, got the winning point, which was worth at least 111+ 111^111
points. Another crushing blow was when Lil’ D dived for the disk of eternal grace, which wasn’t as great as Altan’s supernatural 
jump, but was still enough to seal the deal. At the end, Altan told of the glory of God, and with Lil’ D’s influence stood upon
a podium. Right before he asked the other transitioning saints, who were at that point a group of people with diverse religious
beliefs, to convert, the Transitional Saints in unison acknowledge the power of the Holy Trinity, and submitted themselves to 
the glory of God. Altan, distant ancestor of Clovis, king of the Franks, was raised to the title of King Altan the Pious, to 
which he is known to this day. Everybody was allowed to pass the first section of the first circle of Hell, which Virgil said 
nothing about, for there were many being punished for the Shytiie victories made over the course of history. The final result 
for Lil’ D’s Ultimate Frisbee game was 2-7. A smashing win by -5 points.</p>

<p>From the Gospel of Angela</p>
<p>A History of Trolls:</p>
<p>Sometime in the 1800's in the U.S, a story arose about three goats attempting to cross a bridge. Now, after modern 
historians have inspected and analyzed the story by close reading, they declared that story a fabrication to cover up the 
truth. After interviewing one of the greatest trolls, here's what the actual story is:</p>
<p>Hundreds of years ago, there were some trolls that lived under an unnamed bridge somewhere in the U.S. One day, a saint, 
known specifically as Virgin Mary, walked too close to the bridge. This Saint Mary owned a small, fluffy lamb, whom the trolls
were instantly attracted to, in a non-romantic way. One of these trolls was extremely rich, and offered the innocent Mary 
$9,001 to bribe her into giving the little lamb to him. Saint Mary, being the young, innocent girl she was, accepted this 
bribe and handed over the little lamb to the troll, who salivated in delight. However, this Mary did not realize that she had 
just been trolled since the money was fake! It was too late though; by the time Mary had returned to the bridge to claim back
her lamb, the trolls had already eaten it, bones and all. The trolls, unknowingly, had consumed a holy lamb that transformed 
their appearances into that of a human’s, and were able to disperse throughout human society and live undetected up to this 
day.</p>
<p>Today, in a certain city called Seattle in the most North-Western corner of the U.S, there live a group of trolls under 
the 420 bridge within the campus of the U.W (Unified Waggery) under the cover of TSers (Transitional Saints) and EEPers 
(Everlasting, Enshrined Protectors). In the year of 2015 C.E, there happened to be a divine prophet by the name of Lil' D 
amidst the 18 TSers that year. Since these saints were cooped up in a tiny room for six hours a day learning about life, 
language, history of other species, a bunch of jumbled up letters/numbers/symbols, and restoration, by the time lunch rolled
around, these saints were extremely hungry and longed for a bite. Now, though the saints have long evolved from their 
previous troll forms, many of them still possessed a gene that activated their desire for meat whenever the hunger became
unbearable. With the exception of Saint Jordan, who had abstained from eating meat for so long that he was now immune to the 
effects of this gene, all the other TSers longed for a bite of the savory little lamb that they once consumed whenever driven 
to starvation. Luckily, most of these TSers have not been to that point yet, but now we know why so many people loiter around
the HUB (Holy Union Building), waiting for a taste of the holy lamb…</p>
